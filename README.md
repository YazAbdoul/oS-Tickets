[HELPING EMPLOYEES/INDIVIDUALS THROUGH OS TICKETS SYSTEMS]

Using the softwar oSTicket, I setup a ticket submission system where companies, specified down to - departments, teams, employees, and even managers can submit a ticket to the tech team when they have an issue with their hardware or other IT related problems.
Me as a memebr of the Tech team can Track, manage, reply to these tickets , to start the process of fixing specific issues. to then completing & closing out these tickets.
